Recommended to set up a custom user model when starting a project, 
as you'll be able to easily customize it in the future if the need arises. 

If using a custom user model the code to create the same user would look like this:

# Get current user model from settings
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()

# Create user from model and save to the database
user = User.objects.create_user('myusername', 'myemail@crazymail.com', 'mypassword')

# Update fields and then save again
user.first_name = 'Tyrone'
user.last_name = 'Citizen'
user.save()
